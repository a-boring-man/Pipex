# Pipex

This project was an early project at 42 school that involved creating an executable that would do the work of the ```|``` operator in shell. This project introduced me to new concepts like child processes using ```fork()```, ```dup2()```, and ```pipe()```.

## Bonus

The bonus was to be able to execute an infinite number of arguments, in fact, chaining ```|``` together in the same way as bash does.

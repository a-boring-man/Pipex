# Pipex

A early 42 school project.

the goal was to create an executable doing the work of the | operator un shell.

lots of new notions like child using fork() and dup2() and pipe().

the bonus was to be able to execute an "infinite" number of argument in fact chainning | together in the same way as bash do.
